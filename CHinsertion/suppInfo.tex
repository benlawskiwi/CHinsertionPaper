\section{Reaction schemes for CH insertion}
As there are three unique H atoms on the six-membered rings of ACYN, C-H bond insertion may proceed via three distinct pathways, each leading to a unique tropzyl-like RSR intermediate. One of these pathways, for CH insertion at the 1-position, was presented in Figure~7. The pathways (and corresponding tropyl-like intermediates) for CH insertion at the 2-position and 3-position are shown below in Figures~\ref{figS1} and~\ref{figS2}.
